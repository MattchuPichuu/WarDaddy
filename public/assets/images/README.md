# WarDaddy Assets

## Adding the WarDaddy Logo

To display the WarDaddy logo in your dashboard:

1. Save your WarDaddy image as `wardaddy-logo.png` in this directory
2. The image will automatically appear on:
   - The landing page (large logo)
   - The dashboard header (small icon)

**Image Path:** `public/assets/images/wardaddy-logo.png`

The components include fallback to the Shield icon if the image is not found.
